        <p>Currently I am working in the office and from home with colleagues around the world.</p>
        
        <p>More specifically, I
    <ul>
  <li>share the life and work of the Lutheran World Federation and its 148 member churches</li>
  <li>reflect on what the move to hybrid offices and organizations means in practice and how this will change them</li>
  <li>experiment with static websites and git</li>
  <li>try to learn something new every day</li>
  <li>cycle daily, eat healthy, sleep enough</li>
        </ul>
        </p>    
    
      <p>    Vision and margin make a difference.</p>

        <p>Exploring the intersection between culture, technology, society.</p>
        
        <p>I am a communicator, theologian and an expert in public policy, educated in at the University of Iceland and the University of Uppsala.</p>
        
        <p>I lead the communciations work for The Lutheran World Federation, a communion of 148 churches in the Lutheran tradition. Together we are working to make the world more just and peaceful.</p>

<p>In my work I combine practice and research. I have a passion for the intersection between communication, culture, technology and society, to which I bring a faith and justice perspective. I have researched, lectured and taught university courses on church, culture, and communication.</p>

<p>I have also tried my hand at different media, print, web, tv and radio, but have a particuoar interest in online communities and communication. 

<p>Also, I'm from Iceland. Does that make me unique?</p>

<p>Ps. I also have a <a href="https://arni.blog/now">fancy now page</a>, but it's moved to the blog.</p>
